# Functions

In this programming exercise you will be practicing how to make and call functions.

Your finished product should be a Github URL with one HTML and one JavaScript file inside it (One per group, collaborate on the assignment).

To complete the activity, you will need to do the following:

Define a function named firstLetterName. It should take a string name as a parameter and alert the message "The name <NAME> starts with the letter <FIRSTLETTEROFNAME>
  
HINT: to get a single character of a string, you can use bracket syntax like you used to access array elements

Define a function divisibleByTwo. It should take a single parameter number and determine whether the number input is an even or odd number. If it's even, the function should return true. If it's odd, the function should return false.

HINT: You'll need to use the % operator.

Define a function named largestNum. It should take an array arr as a parameter and loop through that array. The function should return the largest number in the array.

After defining all the functions, call each function at the bottom of the JavaScript file with the appropriate arguments.
